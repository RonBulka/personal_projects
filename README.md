# Personal Projects portfolio
This is a portfolio of my personal and university projects.

## Projects
- [BP simulator](#BP_simulator) - A simple simulator of a branch predictor. Gets a trace file and a predictor type (BTB size, tag size, history size, global or local fsm tables and history, initial fsm state) and returns the accuracy of the prediction. Built using C++.

- [connect4](#connect4) - A simple connect4 game. It's a simple game where two players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a selected number of columns and rows vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Built using basic C.

- [firewall](#firewall) - A simple firewall. It's a simple firewall that blocks or allows packets based on a set of rules. The rules are read from a file and the packets are read from the standard input. The packets are then checked against the rules and the matching results is printed to the standard output. Built using C++ and bash.

- [grades_ADT](#grades_ADT) - Given a linked-list API and a prog.exe. Built a Grades struct storing a list of students and being able to do relevent functions to maintain the struct and get information. Built using C. Compiled into a library and used in the prog.exe.

- [grades_stat_calculator](#grades_stat_calculator) - A simple grades statistics calculator. It's a simple program that reads a file with students grades and calculates the mean, median, min, max and precentage of students that passed. Built using C and bash.

- [pacman](#pacman) - A simple pacman game. It's a simple game where the player controls pacman and tries to eat all the coins while avoiding the ghosts. Built using Verilog and Quartus. Made to run on a FPGA.

- [simple_bash_web_scraper](#simple_bash_web_scraper) - A simple web scraper which searches for a a certain type of link, then looking inside each site the number of times a name from a list appears, outputing everything to a csv file. Built using bash.

- [smash](#smash) - A simple shell that can run built-in commands such as showpid, fg, bg, quit, kill. It can run external commands like to run executables both in the foreground and background. While supporting a "jobs" list of the procces running at the backgroud and proccess that are stopped. Can handle external signals such as ctrl+Z and ctrl+C. Built using C++.

- [stack_ADT](#stack_ADT) - A simple stack ADT. It's a simple stack ADT that can be used to store and retrieve data. Included a student struct which supports the necessary functions to be using the stack. Built using C.
